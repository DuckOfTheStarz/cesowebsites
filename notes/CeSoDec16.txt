Questions to ask:
    - "Additionally, Eurostat (Dr. R. Gatto, EU-LFS coordinator) 
        and the OECD (Dr. A. Garnero & Dr. P.Marianna, labour economist and labour statistician at the
        Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs) have expressed interest in participating as informal external observers."
        Did they ever become IEOs?
